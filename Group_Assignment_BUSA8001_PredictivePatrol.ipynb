Description\n","\n","**Forecasting Problem:** \n","\n","In today's dynamic automobile market, there is no convenient way for a car's owners, purchasers and manufacturers to decide the price of the used vehicle. Our project aims at predicting used cars sale prices based on the characteristics of the car to help the stakeholders decide reasonable price. \n","\n","A Predictive Price Modelling tool whereby a parties can enter all the relevant details such as: back legroom (Legroom in the rear seat), body type of the car(Like Convertible, Hatchback, Sedan, etc), city (Where the car is listed), etc and the Machine Learning Model will suggest the result which includes the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and the Price for the cars. So that prospective car cosumers wanting to confirm they're receiving a reasonable offer for their investment, sellers benefit by aligning their pricing strategies with market dynamics, ensuring profitability while maintaining competitivenessfor their autos, and producers seeking to assess the market's likely reaction to the attributes they integrate into their vehicles. \n","\n","**Evaluation Criteria:** In this project, we will employ RMSD to evaluate the performance of the ***Model which we will use in the next tasks***.\n","\n","Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is a measure used to quantify the difference between two sets of data points, typically representing predicted values and observed values. In machine learning, RMSD provides an advantage as it gives a clear sense of the average magnitude of prediction errors, making it a valuable tool for assessing the accuracy and reliability of regression models.\n","\n","$$\n","RMSD = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\n","$$\n","Where:\n","- $N$ is the total number of observations.\n","- $y_i$ is the observed value for the i-th observation.\n","- $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value for the i-th observation.\n","\n","**Types of Variables/Features:** The datatype of the feature are bool, float64, int64 and object. Here we found that there are 24 variables which are object or string, 13 features are numeric and 2 features are 2 boolean variables.\n","\n","There are  3 types of features:\n","-\tNumerical variables: 'city_fuel_economy', 'engine_displacement', 'highway_fuel_economy', 'horsepower', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'mileage', 'seller_rating', 'daysonmarket', 'dealer_zip', 'savings_amount', 'year','price'.\n","-\tNominal categorical variables: 'vin', 'back_legroom', 'body_type', 'city', 'engine_type','exterior_color', 'front_legroom', 'fuel_tank_volume', 'fuel_type', 'height', 'interior_color', 'length', 'listed_date', 'listing_color', 'make_name', 'maximum_seating', 'model_name', 'power', 'torque', 'transmission', 'transmission_display', 'wheel_system', 'wheelbase', 'width'.\n","-\tBinary categorical variables (True /False): 'franchise_dealer', 'is_new'.\n","\n","**Data Summary and Main Data Characteristics:** Dataset provided are divided into training data and test data separately. The training data, designed to train and validate our forecasting models, consists of 3500 entries and 39 variables (include the target ***price*** variable). while the test dataset which will be used to assess the performance of our predictive models contains 1500 observations and 38 variables. Given the sizable amount of data, it's important to approach it methodically, ensuring that we comprehend the distribution, variance, and relationships between variables.\n","\n","The target variable is ***price*** that we will be predicted in task 3.\n","\n","**Missing values:**  Missing values are a common issue in any real-world dataset. In the initial stages of data exploration, addressing missing values is paramount. Absent data can introduce unintended biases or inaccuracies in our predictive models. An early assessment will pinpoint which attributes lack complete data and the magnitude of these gaps. Depending on the nature and distribution of the missing information, diverse strategies for data imputation will be considered. It's vital to select an approach that maintains the integrity of the original dataset and doesn't skew its intrinsic patterns."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ad30df24-b18b-4f61-975f-ceebe2e2c3ab","metadata":{"id":"ad30df24-b18b-4f61-975f-ceebe2e2c3ab"},"source":["---\n","\n","## Task 2: Data Cleaning, Missing Observations and Feature Engineering\n","- In this task you will follow a set of instructions/questions listed below.\n","- Make sure you explain each answer carefully both in Markdown text and on your video.\n","\n","Total Marks: 12"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"01f4ec3d-4936-4428-a204-04f133210a3d","metadata":{"id":"01f4ec3d-4936-4428-a204-04f133210a3d"},"source":["**Task 2, Question 1**: Clean **all** numerical features so that they can be used in training algorithms.
